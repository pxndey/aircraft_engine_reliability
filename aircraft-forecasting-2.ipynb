The primary objective is to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of these engines based on sensor readings and operational parameters. Predictive maintenance is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing downtime, and ensuring the efficient operation of aircraft.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","\n","The dataset used in this project consists of sensor data and engine settings collected over time. It includes features such as setting parameters, sensor measurements.\n","\n","## Approach\n","\n","The project follows these main steps:\n","\n","1. **Data Preparation:** Merging training and test datasets, calculating RUL, and defining feature columns.\n","2. **Model Selection:** Utilizing Linear Regression as the chosen model for predicting RUL.\n","3. **Training and Evaluation:** Training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n","\n","## Goals\n","\n","- Develop a regression model to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life of aircraft engines.\n","- Understand the significance of various features in determining engine health.\n","- Lay the groundwork for future explorations, potentially incorporating classification tasks for more nuanced predictions.\n","\n","Let's delve into the details of each step and explore the outcomes of our predictive maintenance

The accuracy and classification report indicate its effectiveness in estimating the remaining operational life of aircraft engines. However, it's important to note that no classification task was undertaken in this specific implementation.\n","\n","Future work may involve exploring classification models to predict binary outcomes related to engine health, such as whether an engine will fail within a certain time frame. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of maintenance needs and further enhance the practical applications of predictive maintenance strategies.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":4346942,"sourceId":7888920,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30635,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
